<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

Install the package through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```
composer require "cviebrock/image-validator:2.0.*@beta"
```

**Note:** Version 2.0 of this package is designed to work with Laravel 5.  If you are using Laravel 4, then checkout the `1.x` branch and use the latest version there.

Add the following to your `providers` array in `app/config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => array(
	'Cviebrock\ImageValidator\ImageValidatorServiceProvider',
),
```

## Usage

### image_size

Use it like any `Validator` rule:

```php
$rules = array(
	'my_image_field' => 'image_size:<width>[,<height>]',
);
```

The values for _width_ and _height can be integers, or integers with a modifier prefix:

- `300` or `=300` means the dimension must be exactly 300 pixels.
- `<300` means the dimension must be less than 300 pixels
- `<=300` means the dimension must be less than or equal to 300 pixels
- `>300` means the dimension must be greater than 300 pixels
- `>=300` means the dimension must be greater than or equal to 300 pixels
- `200-300` means the dimension must be betweem 200 and 300 pixels (inclusive)
- `*` means the dimension can be any value

If you only pass one value, it's assumed to apply to both dimensions (i.e. a square image with the given dimensions).

### image_aspect

```php
$rules = array(
	'my_image_field' => 'image_aspect:<ratio>',
);
```

The value for _ratio_ represents _width รท height_ and be either a decimal or two values (width, height; both integers):

- `0.75`
- `3,4`

The value (or first value, if providing height and width) can also be prefixed with a tilde `~` character,
in which case the orientation doesn't matter:

- `~3,4` means the image can have an aspect ratio of either 3:4 or 4:3.

Note that you may run into issues with floating point rounding.

## Examples

```php

	// logo must be 300px wide by 400px tall

	$rules = array(
		'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:300,400',
	);

	// logo must be less than or equal to 300x300px.

	$rules = array(
		'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:<=300',
	);

	// logo must be 300px wide but can be any height

	$rules = array(
		'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:300,*',
	);

	// logo must be at least 100px tall and 200-300 pixels wide (inclusive)

	$rules = array(
		'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:>=100,200-300',
	);

	// logo must be square

	$rules = array(
		'logo' => 'required|image|image_aspect:1',
	);

	// logo must be ready for the big screen TV :)

	$rules = array(
		'logo' => 'required|image|image_aspect:16:9',
	);


```
